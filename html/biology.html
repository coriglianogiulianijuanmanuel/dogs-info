        <h2>Anatomy</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Skeleton</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical
          skeletal structure with the exception of the number of bones in the
          tail, although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of
          different types. The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the
          vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for powerful back
          muscles to connect to, the long ribs provide plenty of room for the
          heart and lungs, and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton
          allowing great flexibility.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since
          domestication has seen the dog's skeleton greatly enhanced in size for
          larger types as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as
          terriers; dwarfism has been selectively utilised for some types where
          short legs are advantageous such as dachshunds and corgis. Most dogs
          naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally
          short tails have as few as three.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but
          there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types.
          The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as
          seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic
          type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by
          mastiff type skulls.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Senses</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          A dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and
          sensitivity to Earth's magnetic field. Another study has suggested
          that dogs can see Earth's magnetic field.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Coat</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being
          familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder
          climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or
          "single", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional
          "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.
          Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age;
          this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear
          of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Tail</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up,
          sickle, curled, or corkscrew. As with many canids, one of the primary
          functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state,
          which can be crucial in getting along with others. In some hunting
          dogs the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Health</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as
          elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft
          palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical conditions significantly
          affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds
          and ages, and Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects
          larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions
          and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as
          fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms,
          which is a roundworm species that lives in the hearts of dogs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs,
          including chocolate solids, causing theobromine poisoning, onions and
          garlic, causing thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning, grapes
          and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol. The nicotine in tobacco can
          also be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include copious
          vomiting (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other
          symptoms are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as
          humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy,
          cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Lifespan</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most,
          the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population
          have died and half are still alive) ranges from 10 to 13 years. The
          median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all
          sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all
          breeds are averaged. For dogs in England, increased body weight has
          been found to be negatively correlated with longevity (i.e., the
          heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan), and mixed-breed dogs live
          on average 1.2 years longer than purebred dogs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one
          year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up
          to two years of age for some large breeds, and is the time at which
          female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience
          subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares
          for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous,
          mentally and physically receptive to copulation. Because the ova
          survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than
          one male can sire the same litter.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation; 14â€“16
          days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus and after
          seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization,
          with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary.
          An average litter consists of about six puppies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Neutering</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removing
          the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, to eliminate
          the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of dogs'
          overpopulation in some countries, many animal control agencies, such
          as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
          (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be
          neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be
          euthanized.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          According to the Humane Society of the United States, three to four
          million dogs and cats are euthanized each year. Many more are confined
          to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there
          are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in
          male dogs. Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop cancers
          affecting the mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.
          However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in
          female dogs and prostate cancer in males and osteosarcoma,
          hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes
          mellitus in either sex.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Inbreeding depression</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          A common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close
          relatives (e.g., between half and full siblings). Inbreeding
          depression is considered to be due mainly to the expression of
          homozygous deleterious recessive mutations. Outcrossing between
          unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in
          the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In a study of seven dog breeds (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset
          Hound, Cairn Terrier, Brittany, German Shepherd Dog, Leonberger, and
          West Highland White Terrier), it was found that inbreeding decreases
          litter size and survival. Another analysis of data on 42,855 Dachshund
          litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter
          size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus
          indicating inbreeding depression. In a study of Boxer litters, 22% of
          puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age. Stillbirth was the most
          frequent cause of death, followed by infection. Mortality due to
          infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.
