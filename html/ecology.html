        <h2>Population</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living
          in the human environment. In 2013, the estimated global dog population
          was between 700 million and 987 million. About 20% of dogs live as
          pets in developed countries. In the developing world, dogs are more
          commonly feral or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon. Most of
          these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by
          humans, with one study showing their most common response when
          approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively
          (11%). Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed
          countries that are feral, strays, or are in shelters because the great
          majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs
          living in human homes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Competitors and predators</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial
          carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with
          other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with
          humans. For example, a review of the studies in dogs' competitive
          effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on
          competition between dogs and wolves. Although wolves are known to kill
          dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they
          are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog
          groups.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together. In some instances,
          wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and
          buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be
          beaten off or killed. Although the numbers of dogs killed each year
          are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and
          farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves have led to
          demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In
          particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have
          been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter what their size.
          Siberian tigers in the Amur River region have killed dogs in the
          middle of villages. This indicates that the dogs were targeted. Amur
          tigers will not tolerate wolves as competitors within their
          territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same way.
          Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in their range.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs have been described as omnivores. Compared to wolves, dogs from
          agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes
          involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability
          to thrive on a starch-rich diet. Similar to humans, some dog breeds
          produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high
          starch diet. However, more like cats and less like other omnivores,
          dogs can only produce bile acid with taurine and they cannot produce
          vitamin D, which they obtain from animal flesh. Also more like cats,
          dogs require arginine to maintain its nitrogen balance. These
          nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and
          omnivores.
        </p>

        <h2>Range</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly
          universal among human societies. Notable exceptions once included:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Aboriginal Tasmanians, who were separated from Australia before
            the arrival of dingos on that continent
          </li>
          <li>
            The Andamanese peoples, who were isolated when rising sea levels
            covered the land bridge to Myanmar
          </li>
          <li>
            The Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, a different
            canid species
          </li>
          <li>
            Individual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring
            dogs, or where dogs died out after original settlement, notably the
            Mariana Islands, Palau and most of the Caroline Islands with
            exceptions such as Fais Island and Nukuoro, the Marshall Islands,
            the Gilbert Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tonga, Marquesas,
            Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter
            Island, the Chatham Islands and Pitcairn Island (settled by the
            Bounty mutineers, who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by
            passing ships).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs were introduced to Antarctica as sled dogs, but were later
          outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of
          spreading infections.
