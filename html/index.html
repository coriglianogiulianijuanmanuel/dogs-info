          The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)
          is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog is derived from an
          ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living
          relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by
          hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of
          agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have
          expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the
          ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
          other canids.

          The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various
          behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds
          vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for
          humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting
          police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled
          people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human
          behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent
          study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
          "man's best friend".
