        <p>
          Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or
          inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and
          external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, dogs' minds
          inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a
          result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the
          ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other
          species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral
          scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive
          abilities in domestic dogs. These abilities are not possessed by the
          dog's closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals,
          such as great apes, but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive
          skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits,
          dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, a study
          found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and
          dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of
          natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and
          behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to
          affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the
          genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e., selection for
          tameness) and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear
          and aggression compared with wolves. Some of these genes have been
          associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their
          importance in both the initial domestication and later in breed
          formation. Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may
          include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in
          humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving
          ability.

        <h2>Intelligence</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and
          retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Studies of two
          dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory
          skills. A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the
          labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel
          things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items
          immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A study of
          another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory
          capabilities. He had learned the names and could associate by verbal
          command over 1,000 words. Dogs can read and react appropriately to
          human body language such as gesturing and pointing and human voice
          commands.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities
          are no more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses,
          chimpanzees, or cats. One limited study of 18 household dogs found
          that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focussed on the "what"
          of a task rather than the "where".
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. An
          experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos
          can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating
          that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original
          problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. Another study
          revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation
          task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look
          at the human, while socialized wolves do not.
        </p>

        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs,
          understand messages from humans and translate the information that
          dogs are transmitting. Communication behaviors of dogs include eye
          gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including
          movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents,
          pheromones, and taste). Humans communicate to dogs by using
          vocalization, hand signals, and body posture.
