          Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition,
          from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with a
          complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition
          and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness and
          ability to fit into human households and social situations. These
          attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled
          them to become one of the most successful animals today.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly
          becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for
          people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting
          police and the military, companionship and aiding disabled
          individuals. This influence on human society has given them the
          nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures,
          however, dogs are also a source of meat.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Pets</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population
          lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs,
          with pet dogs uncommon.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between
          humans and dogs" and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly
          by elites, has a long history. Pet dog populations grew significantly
          after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1950s and
          1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be
          today(the expression "in the doghouse" - recorded since 1932 - to
          describe exclusion from the group implies a distance between the
          doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as
          a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s,
          there have been changes in the pet dog's role, such as the increased
          role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. People
          and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in
          each other's lives to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a
          family and home are experienced.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There have been two significant trends occurring within the second
          half of the 20th century in pet dogs' changing status. The first has
          been "commodification", shaping it to conform to social expectations
          of personality and behavior. The second has been the broadening of the
          family's concept and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday
          routines and practices.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet dog into an
          ideal companion. The list of goods, services, and places available is
          enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing to dog
          groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks
          and beaches and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries. Dog training
          books, classes, and television programs proliferated as the process of
          commodifying the pet dog continued.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of
          the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is
          evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as
          a pack. Some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog
          Whisperer, have promoted a dominance model of dog-human relationships.
          However, it has been disputed that "trying to achieve status" is
          characteristic of dog-human interactions. The idea of the "alpha dog"
          trying to be dominant is based on a disproved theory about wolf packs.
          Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of
          conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the
          dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog; to
          mediate their interactions with each other.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Increasingly, human family-members engage in activities centered on
          the dog's perceived needs and interests, or in which the dog is an
          integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          According to statistics published by the American Pet Products
          Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in
          2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have
          pet dogs. The same source shows that nearly 40% of American households
          own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and
          nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender
          preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal
          number of male and female pet dogs. Although several programs promote
          pet adoption, less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from
          shelters.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare humans and
          dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the
          same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to
          recognize human emotional sounds, making them friendly social pets to
          humans.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Workers</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles. In addition to
          dogs' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for herding
          livestock (collies, sheepdogs), hunting (hounds, pointers) and rodent
          control (terriers). Other types of working dogs include search and
          rescue dogs, detection dogs trained to detect illicit drugs or
          chemical weapons; guard dogs; dogs who assist fishermen with the use
          of nets; and dogs that pull loads. In 1957, the dog Laika became the
          first animal to be launched into Earth orbit, aboard the Soviets'
          Sputnik 2; she died during the flight.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide
          dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs and psychiatric service
          dogs, assist individuals with disabilities. Some dogs owned by people
          with epilepsy have been shown to alert their handler when the handler
          shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of
          onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical
          care.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Athletes and models</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          People often enter their dogs in competitions, such as
          breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding and
          agility competitions. In conformation shows, also referred to as breed
          shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates
          individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed
          type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only
          deals with the dog's externally observable qualities (such as
          appearance, movement and temperament), separately tested qualities
          (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in
          conformation shows.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Food</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea,
          China, Vietnam and the Philippines, which dates back to antiquity.
          Based on limited data, it is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are
          killed and consumed in Asia every year. In China, debates have ensued
          over banning the consumption of dog meat. Following the Sui and Tang
          dynasties of the first millennium, however, people living on northern
          China's plains began to eschew eating dogs, which is likely due to
          Buddhism and Islam's spread, two religions that forbade the
          consumption of certain animals, including the dog. As members of the
          upper classes shunned dog meat, it gradually became a social taboo to
          eat it, even though the general population continued to consume it for
          centuries afterward. Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of
          Switzerland. Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian
          Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. Dog fat is also
          reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs in some parts of
          Poland and Central Asia. Proponents of eating dog meat have argued
          that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is Western
          hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals'
          meat.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the Nureongi, differs
          from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their
          homes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The most popular Korean dog dish is called bosintang, a spicy stew
          meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months. Followers
          of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing
          one's gi, or the body's vital energy. A 19th-century version of
          bosintang explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with
          scallions and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and
          bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still prevalent in Korea with a
          segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, pork
          and chicken.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Health risks</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 2018, the WHO reported that 59,000 people died globally from
          rabies, with 59.6% in Asia and 36.4% in Africa. Rabies is a disease
          for which dogs are the most important vector. Significant dog bites
          affect tens of millions of people globally each year. Children in
          mid-to-late childhood are the largest percentage bitten by dogs, with
          a greater risk of injury to the head and neck. They are more likely to
          need medical treatment and have the highest death rate. Sharp claws
          with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that
          can lead to serious infections.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the U.S., cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each
          year. It has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries
          treated in U.K. hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study found
          that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to
          quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly
          involved two-wheeled vehicles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Toxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause
          toxocariasis. In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara
          infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S.
          population is infected. Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal
          damage and decreased vision. Dog feces can also contain hookworms that
          cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Health benefits</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans; these include
          cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurologic disorders. Their
          pathology is similar to humans, as is their response to treatment and
          their outcomes. Researchers are identifying the genes associated with
          dog diseases similar to human disorders, but lack mouse models to find
          cures for both dogs and humans. The genes involved in canine
          obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in
          humans' related pathways.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship
          can enhance human physical health and psychological well-being.
          Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and
          psychological well-being have been criticized for being poorly
          controlled. It found that "the health of elderly people is related to
          their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of,
          or attachment to, a companion animal." Earlier studies have shown that
          people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical
          health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and
          being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A 2005 paper states "recent research has failed to support earlier
          findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of
          cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner
          services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for
          community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to
          significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among
          children who live with pets." In one study, new guardians reported a
          highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first
          month following pet acquisition. This effect was sustained in those
          with dogs through to the end of the study.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          People with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than
          those with cats and those without pets. The results provide evidence
          that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and
          behavior and that for guardians of dogs, these effects are relatively
          long-term. Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased
          coronary artery disease survival. Human guardians are significantly
          less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction
          than those who did not own dogs. The association between dog ownership
          and adult physical activity levels has been reviewed by several
          authors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in
          general, not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in a
          pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular,
          behavioral and psychological indicators of anxiety. Other health
          benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating
          microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune
          diseases according to the hygiene hypothesis. The benefits of contact
          with a dog also include social support, as dogs cannot only provide
          companionship and social support themselves but also act as
          facilitators of social interactions between humans. One study
          indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social
          interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they
          are not. In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly
          more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet
          owners.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the
          late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental
          institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.
          Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted
          therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and
          laughing, among people with Alzheimer's disease. One study
          demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who
          participated in an education program with dogs and other animals
          showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives
          and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those not
          in an animal-assisted program.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Cultural importance</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty,
          fidelity, faithfulness, alertness, and love. In ancient Mesopotamia,
          from the Old Babylonian period until the Neo-Babylonian, dogs were the
          symbol of Ninisina, the goddess of healing and medicine, and her
          worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her.
          In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs were used as
          emblems of magical protection. In China, Korea and Japan, dogs are
          viewed as kind protectors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs. Stories of
          dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout
          Indo-European mythologies and may originate from Proto-Indo-European
          religion. In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed,
          dragon-tailed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades. Dogs are also
          associated with the Greek goddess Hecate. In Norse mythology, a
          bloody, four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim. In Persian
          mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge. In Welsh
          mythology, Annwn is guarded by Cŵn Annwn. In Hindu mythology, Yama,
          the god of death, owns two watchdogs who have four eyes. They are said
          to watch over the gates of Naraka. A black dog is also considered to
          be the vahana (vehicle) of Bhairava (an incarnation of Shiva).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness. Within the Roman
          Catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of Saint Dominic
          includes a dog, after the hallow's mother dreamt of a dog springing
          from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly after that. As such, the
          Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis) means "dog of the
          Lord" or "hound of the Lord" (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis). In
          Christian folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog
          to guard Christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege.
          Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets. Jewish law
          requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before
          themselves and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining
          them. The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought
          viewing it as unclean, although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this
          view is based on "pre-Islamic Arab mythology" and "a tradition to be
          falsely attributed to the Prophet." Therefore, Sunni Malaki and Hanafi
          jurists permit the trade of and keeping of dogs as pets.
