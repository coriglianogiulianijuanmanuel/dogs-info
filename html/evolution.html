          The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event occurred 65 million years
          ago and brought an end to the dinosaurs and the appearance of the
          first carnivorans. The name carnivoran is given to a member of the
          order Carnivora. Carnivorans possess a common arrangement of teeth
          called carnassials, in which the first lower molar and the last upper
          premolar possess blade-like enamel crowns that act similar to a pair
          of shears for cutting meat. This dental arrangement has been modified
          by adaptation over the past 60 million years for diets composed of
          meat, for crushing vegetation, or for the loss of the carnassial
          function altogether as in seals, sea lions, and walruses. Today, not
          all carnivorans are carnivores, such as the insect-eating Aardwolf.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The carnivoran ancestors of the dog-like caniforms and the cat-like
          feliforms began their separate evolutionary paths just after the end
          of the dinosaurs. The first members of the dog family Canidae appeared
          40 million years ago, of which only its subfamily the Caninae survives
          today in the form of the wolf-like and fox-like canines. Within the
          Caninae, the first members of genus Canis appeared six million years
          ago, the ancestors of modern domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, and
          golden jackals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Domestication</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated
          dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic,
          genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a
          local wolf. The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried
          along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red
          hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog
          had died of canine distemper. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000
          years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as
          dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological
          diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be
          domesticated in the time of hunter–gatherers, which predates
          agriculture. DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share
          a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf
          population which was distinct from the modern wolf lineage. Most dogs
          form a sister group to the remains of a Late Pleistocene wolf found in
          the Kessleroch cave near Thayngen in the canton of Schaffhausen,
          Switzerland, which dates to 14,500 years ago. The most recent common
          ancestor of both is estimated to be from 32,100 years ago. This
          indicates that an extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the
          ancestor of the dog, with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest
          living relative.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely
          travelled a commensal pathway into domestication. The questions of
          when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and
          archaeologists for decades. Genetic studies suggest a domestication
          process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf
          populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. In
          2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog
          was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North
          Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and
          westward across Eurasia.

        <h2>Breeds</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally
          recognized dog breeds. In the Victorian era, directed human selection
          developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of
          phenotypes. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders
          within the last 200 years, and since then dogs have undergone rapid
          phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to
          artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull, body, and limb
          proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying
          more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of
          carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to
          morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur
          type and colour. Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding,
          and hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits
          include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression, which
          demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. As a
          result, present day dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and
          are dispersed around the world. The most striking example of this
          dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage
          during the Victorian era.
